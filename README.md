# Telco-Classification-Project
Telco Classification Project

## Project description with goals
### Description
* Customer churn is a problem for any company as lost customers represent lost revenues. To compound general business studies have shown that new customer acquisition costs far exceed customer retention efforts. Therefor, controlling customer churn is a double benefit effort that could substantially improve Telco stakeholder returns.  

### GoalsÂ¶
* Discover account features that provide predictve value for customer churn
* Provide a model use in predicting which customers will likely churn
* Provide recomendations to stakeholders for reducing churn

## Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas
There should be some combination of features that can be used to build apredictive model for cutomer churn 
* 1. Do any of the demographic features provide relevant preditive value for churn?
* 2. Do catagorical customer account features provide relevant predictive value for churn?
* 3. Do numerical customer account features provide relevant predictive value for churn?
* 4. Do any of the service features provide relevant predictive value for churn? 

** Project Plan 
*** Acquire data from Codeup DB Server
*** Prepare data
    **** Create Engineered columns from existing data
        ***** contract_types
        ***** customer_churn
        ***** customer_contracts
        ***** customer_details
        ***** customer_payments
        ***** customers
        ***** customer_signups
        ***** customer_subscriptions
        ***** internet_service_types
        ***** payment_types
*** Explore data in search of drivers of churn
    **** Answer the folowwing initial questions
        ***** 1. Do any of the demographic features provide relevant preditive value for churn?
        ***** 2. Do catagorical customer account features provide relevant predictive value for churn?
        ***** 3. Do numerical customer account features provide relevant predictive value for churn?
        ***** 4. Do any of the service features provide relevant predictive value for churn? 
*** Develop a model to predict if a customer will churn
*** Draw conclusions

##Steps to Reproduce
* 1.Clone this repo.
* 2.Acquire the data from Codeup DB Server
* 3.Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
* 4.Run notebook.

## Takeaways and Conclusions
* Of the features examined these provided statiscally relevant predictive value for predicting customer churn
** Account features
*** tenure
*** monthly_charges
** Demographic features
*** partner_Yes
*** dependents_Yes
** Other features
*** tech_support_Yes
*** internet_service_type_fiber_optic
*** payment_type_electronic_check
*Three major drivers
** Customers with Fiber Optic Internet Service churn faster than others
** Customers without Tech support turn at a higher rate than those with it
** Legacy customers are less likly to churn than newer customers

# Recomendations
* Implement the model provided and work with the marketing to form retention programs to reduce the churn rate for the company.
* These programs can be offered to seperate test markets derived from this model and later be evaluated to determine which retention program works best
* Investigate reason for fiber optic customers without tech support churning faster than others
